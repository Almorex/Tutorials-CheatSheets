# Tutorials-CheatSheets
Often Times whenever you learn a new framework/libaray/language you tend to forget it if you don't use it that often. Our mind has capacities and we can't know everything at once. That is the motivavtion behind this repository.

The main purpose of this repository is to share knowledge. Make Cheat Sheets/ Revision Sheets of the Framework/Language/Library you studied or learnt so that not only you even others can learn from it and use it as a ready to go reference.

It would be really great if you shared your knowledge about the same with everyone here.

Also, if you're contributing make sure that the points aren't too verbose. Try to keep it brief as it is just a ready reference and not at all for anyone who is complete new or beginner in the field.
